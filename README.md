# Hello-World :earth_americas:
A repository about me (myself during my college years) :smile:.

**NOTICE** :loudspeaker:

This repository provides an overview of a blog that I created during my college period to share more about myself.

### Introduction :rocket:

My name is Brady Fomegne. I'm from Cameroon and in this repository, I will share more about myself.

### My First Programming Language :books:

I started programming around June 2015, and Python was my first programming language.

**Why Python?** :thinking:

When I began to develop an interest in programming, I was looking for a programming language to learn.
After several online researches, I discovered Python.
It seemed easy at first glance, and I started learning it every day.
There were moments when I felt like giving up, but I persevered.

**My First Program** :bulb:

`print("Hello World")` :laughing:

After writing it :gear: and executing it :computer:, I was thrilled.
It may seem trivial now, but at that time, it was amazing! :cool:

**Doing More** :muscle:

I wanted to learn everything about Python. I learned:

- Graphical User Interface (GUI) programming with Tkinter
- Socket programming
- And much more...

**When did I start learning Tcl/Tk?** :hourglass_flowing_sand:

To enhance my GUI with Python, I was trying to learn more about Tkinter.
I discovered this platform [TkDocs](https://tkdocs.com).
Alongside the Python Tkinter code, there were Perl, Ruby, and Tcl equivalent codes.
At first glance, I noticed that the Tcl code was shorter and simpler.
After some research, I discovered that Tkinter is built on top of Tcl/Tk.
Out of curiosity, I started learning Tcl/Tk and building GUI interfaces with it.

### Conclusion :end:

I am passionate about programming and aspire to become a software engineer in the future. :mortar_board:
